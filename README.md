# Invaders
A game that I made for my Computer Engineering course (Um jogo que eu fiz pro meu curso de engenharia da computação)

Disclamer:
Yes, I may not have commented on it alot and mixed everithing into a single file, but I was trying to learn how to do it and didn't realized at the time how important it's
to make clear what I'm doing in a code, and also how much easyer it's to enclose and isolate codes in separate files.

I made the players and bullets moviments watching tutorials, I addapted it to create the enemies, so, that's the only part I quite took from other sources, the rest were
made by trying and failing, so my methods may not be the best way of performing actions in general. 

I'm also not intreasting in working on this project further, feel free to lean from it by yourself.

(The original song I used on this game was Sladge form Danscing With The Dead, if you wanna see the original experience, just change the song, I expended some time 
finding a new song for it)
